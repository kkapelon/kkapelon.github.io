						src="img/armory-io-logo.png" /></a></h2>
			<p><a href="https://www.spinnaker.io">Spinnaker</a> is the newcomer in the continuous delivery arena. It was
				open-sourced by Netflix as a multi-cloud deployment tool. Spinnaker is one of the first and only
				applications that is built for cloud deployments from the ground up. It supports natively the blue/green
				deployment strategy as well as canary deployments, features that until recently required special scripts
				and glue code. Spinnaker supports all major cloud providers (Amazon, Azure, Openstack etc) and even
				native Kubernetes integration implemented by Google itself.</p>

			<p><a href="http://www.armory.io">Armory</a> is the company behind Enterprise Spinnaker support. They also
				offer extra Spinnaker integrations on top of the basic OSS distribution, specifically tailored for large
				companies that want to move to the cloud. I have been writing guest blog posts for Armory:</p>

			<h2>Collaboration with SemaphoreCI 2016-2017 <a href="http://semaphoreci.com"><img class="floater-right"
						src="img/semaphoreci-logo.png" /></a></h2>
			<p><a href="http://semaphoreci.ci">SemaphoreCI</a> is a hosted continuous integration company similar to <a
					href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis</a>. I was already aware of them while researching my <a
					href="http://blog.codepipes.com/hosted-ci-comparison/hosted-ci-comparison.html">mega comparison of
					hosted CI</a> services.</p>

			<p>In 2016 they read my Spock book, liked it and contacted me in order to write articles for their huge
				library of <a href="https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials">testing tutorials</a>. I accepted and
				so far I have written 4 Testing/CI tutorials for them! Three of them have been in the top ten of the
				respective year. The <a href="http://rest-assured.io" />RestAssured</a> tutorial is one of the most
				commented tutorials.

			<p>If you are looking for a hosted CI service, I can highly recommend them. For the full details consult the
				<a href="http://blog.codepipes.com/hosted-ci-comparison/hosted-ci-comparison.html#semaphoreci">mega
					comparison</a> that compares SemaphoreCI with 11 competitors in the same sector.

			<h2>Collaboration with Manning publications 2014-2015 <a
					href="https://www.manning.com/books/java-testing-with-spock"><img width="238" height="300"
						class="floater-right" src="book/java-testing-with-spock-book.jpg" /></a></h2>
			<p>In 2014, <a href="http://www.manning.com/">Manning</a> noticed my <a
					href="https://blog.codepipes.com/testing/spock-for-java.html">Spock article</a> and asked me to
				write a full book on the topic. Of course I accepted! Manning is a legend of technical books and I have
				learned a lot by their huge collection on Java topics. </p>

			<p>My book is titled "Java testing with Spock". It is aimed at Java developers entrenched in JUnit, and it
				will attempt to convince them that
				<a href="https://spock-framework.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">Spock</a> is an one-stop-shop for all
				testing needs. Unlike JUnit, Spock also has built-in mocking/stubbing support and favours a BDD style
				when describing test fixtures.
				Combined with the expressive power of Groovy (and the power assert killer feature), Spock is an
				explosive package that can replace/augment/accompany
				existing JUnit tests in a much more concise way

			<h2>Collaboration with ZeroTurnaround 2013 <a href="http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/"><img

			<p>While working for InfoQ I also covered <a href="http://zeroturnaround.com/software/jrebel/">JRebel</a>
				and <a href="http://zeroturnaround.com/software/liverebel/">LiveRebel</a>, products of <a
					href="http://zeroturnaround.com/">ZeroTurnaround</a>. As part of the process I interviewed <a
					href="http://cz.linkedin.com/in/thinkingoutloud">Oliver White</a> the marketing
				guru of the company (at the time). We talked while drinking beers, and I started writing for <a
					href="http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/">RebelLabs</a> (the community building part of
				ZeroTurnaround). I wrote <blog posts for any topic I liked and helped with the detailed programming
					reports.</p>

					<p>I really enjoyed my time with ZeroTurnound because of the freedom I had while choosing topics and
						writing
						about them. After the rigid structure of InfoQ, I could finally inserts jab and puns in my
						articles!
						Here is a full list of my articles:</p>

					<ul>

					<h2>Collaboration with InfoQ 2011-2013 <a href="http://www.infoq.com/"><img class="floater-right"
								src="img/infoq-logo.png" /></a></h2>
					<p>In 2011 I started working for <a href="http://www.infoq.com/">InfoQ</a>. I already liked the site
						as a
						reader because of their objective writing and the no-marketing-crap attitute when covering press
						releases. At several points in time I simply disregarded the official release of a product and
						went
						straight to InfoQ in order to read the actual details. The team at InfoQ are mostly programmers
						themselves so they can see behind the marketing buzzwords and actually explain the technical
						facets of
						various topics. </p>
					<p>I too specialized in product releases for Java software. Even though the news posts are not
						lengthy,
						writing them was always a challenge because I had to verify/research with no actual
						documentation at
						hand (the products were just released). I <a
							href="http://www.infoq.com/author/Kostis-Kapelonis">wrote
							more than 30 news posts</a> for various topics. Here is a sample selection:</p>

					<p>I was so mindblown when researching <a
							href="http://www.infoq.com/news/2011/10/chronon-20">Chronon</a>

					<h2>Academic work</h2>
					<p><strong>Tagged Procedure Calls (TPC): Efficient
							runtime support for task-based parallelism on
							the Cell Processor (2010)</strong> was a paper I co-authored as part of my work in <a
							href="http://www.ics.forth.gr/">FORTH-ICS</a>. It uses the <a
							href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(microprocessor)">Cell processor</a> of the <a
							href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3_technical_specifications">Playstation 3</a>
						as a
						core platform for parallel C code. I wrote bare metal code for this project (truly exciting
						stuff!).
						Read it in <a href="resources/Tagged-Procedure-Calls-Cell-2010.pdf">PDF format</a></p>

					<p><strong>Translating formal proofs into English (2004)</strong> was my postgraduate thesis in the
						<a href="http://www.swansea.ac.uk/">University of Swansea</a>. Implemented in <a
							href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29">Scheme</a>
						it was a module of the <a href="http://www.mathematik.uni-muenchen.de/~logik/minlog/">Minlog
							interactive
							proof system</a>. It used as input mathematical proofs and it produced a human-language
						explanation
						of the proof. This is the
						time I learned about functional programming (an eye-opener experience). Read it in <a
							href="resources/Translating-formal-proofs-into-English-2004.pdf">PDF format</a>
					</p>

					<p><strong>Compact Flash Linux Block driver (2003)</strong> was my dimploma thesis in the <a
							href="http://www.csd.uoc.gr/en/">University of Crete</a>. It explains the implementation of
						a block
						device driver for the 2.4.x Linux kernel. The driver is for a <a
							href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CompactFlash">compact flash</a> disk reader soldered in
						an <a href="http://www.dilnetpc.com/">embedded Linux board</a>. Read it in <a
