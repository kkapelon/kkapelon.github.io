By now you should know that Evas is a canvas. But what makes it different from
the other solutions that already exist?  Each mature toolkit provides its own
Canvas widget which if used correctly can really give the edge to your
application. Let's see a quick summary of Evas features versus the traditional
solutions.

While most users will perceive Evas-based applications as impressive applications with low requirements for computer
resources, for developers things are different. The way you program Evas is a refreshing change from what you
have seen before. Most of the points presented on the table are fairly easy to understand.
</p><p>
The last point regarding the speed of Evas is the easiest to recognize once you start programming with EFL. 
Graphic routines are highly optimized and carefully profiled (even for the software back-end) so that Evas
really feels fast for users. If you ever hated Canvas widgets for their lack of speed, problematic scrolling,
and low-quality resizing, Evas might be just what you are looking for.
</p><p>
We devote two separate sections on the key features that we think make Evas truly evolutionary.

What "Image-based" Means
</h2></div></div></div><p>
Since computers became capable of displaying graphics, pixel-based images
comprise the bulk of visual output presented on user screens. Images stored in
pixels take a lot of space to store, but are rather easy and fast to load and
display. The pixel information is stored on a big 2D array (in the simplest
case) and displaying graphics means simply copying the colour values
from file to screen (not exactly but you get the idea).
</p><p>
Apart from the problem with storage space, pixel-based graphics suffer also
from fixed quality and resolution dependence. If the user has a big screen,
graphics will look small, while in the opposite case graphics will look
really cramped since the screen estate is constrained. This problem is
especially evident with application icons which can not be easily resized
and keep their sharpness. Current solutions are forced to include
different sizes of icons for 3 or 4 possible resolutions in order to
accommodate for different uses. This not only increases disk space
requirements but also adds complexity to loading and locating the
appropriate icon file. Well known is the fact that wallpapers for common
desktop environments come in different sizes. But what happens if you use
1600x1200 resolution and your favourite wallpaper comes in 1024x768?
</p><p>
The software platforms are slowly but steadily moving to vector graphics.
Vector graphics are destined to replace pixel-based graphics in many fields.
Files which contain vector-based graphics do not store any pixel information at
all. They rather contain a <span class="emphasis"><em>mathematical representation</em></span> of
an image. When the file is displayed the computer plots the mathematical
function in real time on screen, and the user sees an image which is actually
the result of rendered graphics.
</p><p>
The big advantage of vector graphics is the fact that they are truly resolution
independent. Because the graphical representation is computed in real-time for
each display, graphics will look the same (and always sharp) no matter the
canvas they are rendered on. If you have 1600x1200 display your image will be
rendered with these coordinates while if you have 1024x768 graphics will again
be recomputed to adapt to the new resolution. Both open-source desktop
environments support vector-based icons (stored in the svg format) which
showcase that icon resizing can result in big, sharp icons with no loss of
quality.
</p><p>
On the downside of course, this real-time rendering puts a load on the computer
processor, since it has to calculate the result of the function each time the
image is displayed. A pixel-based image will be loaded in a fraction of time
that the same image will be displayed if stored in vector format. The vector-based file will
be significantly smaller though, than the pixel-based one since only the math behind the image is stored
rather than all the pixels.
</p><p>
Vector-based graphics will never be used for digital photos of course since these need pixels for information.
Computer interfaces on the other size are a natural candidate for vector graphics. Being resolution
independent is a big plus for applications. And since processors get faster each year, the rendering overhead
will slowly disappear.
</p><p>
This is is the reason why many Canvas widgets are vector based. They implement
a complex mathematical layout engine (can be even postscript) which allows the
programmer to display complex graphics with anti-aliasing, sharp edges and
curved lines all in a rectangular window which is resolution agnostic. This might
be perfect for mathematical and plotting applications (or even for custom
widgets) but not for complete interfaces. This kind of canvas
widgets can also not be used on embedded systems which have limited processing
capacity and vector graphics will be inherently slow. The next figure outlines
the shortcomings.
</p><div class="figure"><a id="id2495523"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 3.1. Workflow in your favourite Canvas widget</b></p><div><img src="img/Canvas.png" alt="Workflow in your favourite Canvas widget" /></div></div><p>
Evas takes a completely different approach. While most Canvas widgets can also
display pixel-based images as an extra feature, Evas is actually targeted on
them. The Evas primitive list is rather short. Text, rectangles, lines, polygons,
and images are the most basic primitives.  You won't find arcs, circles,
arrows, bezier curves, or any other traditional Canvas methods if you search
the Evas documentation. To create an Evas based interface you store all
elements in normal pixel-based files (e.g. in PNG format) and have Evas
load and resize them when the interface is activated. The interface
elements themselves can be processed with Gimp as normal images or even be
created as vectors in Inkscape and later converted to pixels and
distributed as a theme.
</p><p>
This means that graphics are no longer a job of the programmer but become a job of the Gimp artist/Guru where
they belong. Evas does not suffer from complex layout mathematical languages and therefore can be used on
embedded systems too. Evas graphics are not resolution independent, but since Evas has rather sophisticated
resizing algorithms (as imlib2) for most cases graphics will maintain their quality. The following
figure shows the main idea.
</p><div class="figure"><a id="id2495563"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 3.2. Workflow in Evas.</b></p><div><img src="img/Evas.png" alt="Workflow in Evas." /></div></div><p>
So will Evas boost your applications? If your canvas is going to plot complex mathematic functions for 
a scientific application then Evas won't help you much. But if you intend to create a beautiful application
with interface elements scrolling around the screen, windows sliding in and out, and crazy animations composed
of many picture frames, then Evas will certainly come to rescue you.
