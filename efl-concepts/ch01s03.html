Once you want to actually start using the EFL libraries you have
the following options:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="bullet" compact="compact"><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Getting binary packages for your distribution.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Downloading snapshots of selected libraries.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Downloading directly from CVS.</p></li><li style="list-style-type: disc"><p>Running/installing the E-live CD.</p></li></ul></div><p>
Downloading binary packages (e.g. rpm and deb) for your distribution is the
preferred way. Since Enlightenment and libraries are not released yet
officially, this is not possible. You have to track unofficial packages
prepared by enthusiastic users. While this might be the safest way to obtain
EFL, it actually means that you depend on the packager. If packages are not
updated regularly, you are on your own.
</p><p>
The recommended way, if you are not adventurous enough, is downloading the source
packages from freedesktop.org. These are updated regularly by EFL developers
once they think that the libraries are in a stable state safe for a snapshot.
Note that not all available EFL libraries are posted there.  You miss
experimental stuff, and, of course, you can only update when new versions are
added. Still, the sources compile cleanly, and you can always get more bleeding
edge stuff from CVS if you want it.
</p><p>
If you would prefer the latest and greatest, you can download the source directly
from the CVS servers. This is is the preferred way if you want to submit bugs
or patches and generally get involved in development. CVS builds are known to
break. If you download your snapshot while a developer is undertaking major
changes, it is pretty common that your copy is non-functional. CVS also suffers
from problems outside of the control of core developers. Availability of the
CVS server and load has lately been a problem (hopefully solved).
</p><p>
Finally, you can download the E-live CD. This is a Live CD based on Enlightenment and Debian. It is a great
way to see EFL in action without touching the system or to show off to your friends. If you are really impressed
you can install the CD to your PC and get a Debian GNU/Linux system with the EFL libraries pre-installed.
