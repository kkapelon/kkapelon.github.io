title: Subtle signs that you just got hired in the wrong IT company
category: people

Passing the interview process and landing a new job is always
an overwhelming experience. This is especially true if you are
also a recent graduate and this is your first job. You are filled
with equal amounts of excitement and anxiety for what lies
ahead. Is this company finally the dream job?

If you are a seasoned veteran and have already changed
companies a few times, you should hopefully also know what
to address in the interview process in order to avoid “bad”
companies. Information Technology is slowing becoming an
integral part for all companies, not just software ones. So, it
is important to understand that the level of software maturity
and how a company treats the software development process
differs a lot between each organization

Unfortunately, this also means that several people are
working for companies with less than ideal conditions without even realizing that this is not how things are supposed
to be. It is very easy to stay for several years in a company –
becoming another cog – if you are not aware that your daily
routine would be much better in another organization.

For this purpose, in this article, we will see a list of 10 red
flags that should tell you whether your current company
treats software development in a serious manner or if you
should be preparing your CV for your next position.

### Red flag 1: You get hired and there is no workstation/laptop/desk for you

Now don’t get me wrong. If you arrive in the morning and
they tell you that your desk will be ready in the afternoon, everything is fine. If you arrive on Monday and the company
has a full training program for the whole week until your
workstation arrives on Friday, this is also fine.

But arriving in your department and realizing that you have
no equipment to work for more than a day is a red flag. First of
all, it shows that the company is unorganized in general. Ordering a new workstation is not rocket science. In a big company, the amount of spare equipment should at least prevent
such cases by providing a temporary solution. If the company
cannot meet the deadline of delivery for a single workstation,
can it meet the deadline for a complex software project?

Secondly, it shows neglect from the people involved in your
hiring process. The HR manager, your department manager,
and even your new team leader should all be concerned with
what you should be doing in your first month. If your inability to work does not concern them, it means that your position
is not a critical one and was only created for some unrelated
reason (e.g. budget allocation).

In summary, waiting for more than 1-2 days for your workstation to arrive should only happen with an important excuse. Fun fact: I know a person that waited for two months
until getting a workstation. In the meantime he was just
reading books for the technologies used in the project. He no
longer works for that company.

### Red flag 2: Developers are isolated from everybody else (even their managers)

Remember that the hiring interview is a two-way evaluation
process. The company evaluates you and you evaluate them
back. During the interview, always ask to see the working
space for the developers. This will tell you a lot about the
company. It’s a really big red flag if a company refuses to
show you where developers work until you get hired. If this
happens, then just say thank you and walk out of the door.

When you do get to see the other developers, notice the
mood on their faces. Are they sad? Exhausted? Demotivated?
These are signs of your future if you work there. However, an
important thing to also notice is the location of managers according to their respective team. Ideally, each manager should
be in the same space as the teams they are managing.

Working in a team means that everybody is communicating with one another. Effective communication is one of the
pillars of software development. Communication between developers themselves but also between developers and managers is something that should happen easily and spontaneously.
If the managers are in a completely different building than
their developers, it means that the company not only hinders
communication between the teams, but also treats developers
as sweatshop workers that should stay in their rooms (usually in the basement) producing software like working on a
factory floor.

Multidisciplinary teams are a huge plus for all companies
that understand that software is a collaborative process. Your
team should be a mix of developers, test engineers, designers,
and managers. All of them should be collocated in the same
space. The only exception to this rule is if the company works
in a remote or distributed manner. But, for the run-of-the-mill typical corporate organization, looking at the allocation
of people between buildings is an important factor to understand how easy communication is between members.

### Red flag 3: Daily stand-up meetings take more than 15 minutes

Without getting into details about the Agile process, it is at
least important to understand the purpose of the daily stand-up meeting. The objectives of this meeting are well defined.
Each person on the team has three questions they should answer:

1. What work was finished the previous day for the sprint?
1. What work will be done today for the sprint?
1. Is there a blocker issue that prevents work?

That’s it! These are the only topics that should be mentioned.
The stand-up meeting is not a discussion, it is not a stakeholder status update, it is not an analysis meeting, and it is
certainly not a brainstorming session. Yet, a lot of companies
misuse it and let stand-up meetings drag on for one or even
two hours instead of the original 15 minute deadline.

This is a red flag for multiple reasons. Firstly, it wastes
everybody’s time. Discussing topics that are only relevant to
some members of the team is demotivating for the rest of the
people. It is ok if extra discussions happen after the stand-up,
but only if they contain the subset of the team that is actually
involved or needed.

Secondly, it shows that the company does not understand
what Agile is. If the company misinterprets a 15 minute stand-up as a full hour meeting, it will probably misinterpret other
parts of the software lifecycle as well such as time to deployment, code quality, commit feedback loop, etc.

Lastly, it shows a lack of effective management in general.
If the stand-up meeting has become a status update for stakeholders, it means that the existing "official" process for actually getting a status update is not enough. Therefore, people
are misusing the stand-up as a substitute.

### Red flag 4: Your new team is indifferent towards you

Typically, getting a new person in a team should be a positive experience. Ideally, the team needed a new member, a
position was announced, and the interview process finished
with your arrival on the scene! Maybe you have a skill that
the team needed. Maybe you will be trained on something the
team needed. Maybe a new project started and the team size
needs to be adjusted.

Your new team should welcome you and make it easy for
you to blend in. A mentor should be assigned to you that
will be responsible for your onboarding process. Your team
is also your primary source of information in the starting
months.

Now, it goes without saying that getting a negative reaction
from your team is a huge red flag. If your new team is actively
aggressive towards you then something is really wrong with
the company. However, a big negative sign is also indifference
towards you. If the team is apathetic towards you, there are
two possible reasons why.

First, the company may have a bad working environment
and thus a huge personnel turnover. People are coming and
going all the time in your department. Maybe new developers are getting hired, see the mess in the code or the software process, and instantly search for another company.
In that case, your team knows that you will leave once you
realize the situation. So, they don’t feel like they should invest in you. Alternatively, they are the ones that are already
applying to leave, so they don’t feel they should make any
connection with you if they are going to change companies
soon.

The second reason might be that simply your team does not
care. After so many long hours, missed deadlines, frantic firelights, and time-consuming meetings they simply do not have
the energy to welcome you and connect with you.

Both reasons are equally bad. Your team’s reaction towards you says a lot of things about the time you will stay in
the company.

### Red flag 5: Team bonding comes from working long hours

You join your new team and, after some time, you realize that
people know intimate details about one another. Everybody
knows everything about every other team member and topics
that are discussed within the team are the same ones that you
would discuss with very close friends.

It is important to understand quickly where this attitude
comes from. Of course there are some very rare cases where
a team is composed of like-minded people who enjoy working together and are also meeting outside of work or in company team bonding events. In most cases, however, a good
colleague is not always a good friend. While it is perfectly
normal to make friends from some work colleagues, it is highly unlikely that you would like to discuss your personal matters with your whole team.

Unfortunately a more common occurrence is having teams
that are working really long hours to meet deadlines. Working 12-14 hours every day and even weekends with another
person will force you to bond with that person since the job
starts to become your full life. People are especially more likely to bond with one another under periods of heavy pressure
and stress, as there is the common feeling of having to endure
the same problems together.

This is a red flag because, while on the surface you see a
well bonded team, the big problem is the long hours the company imposes on its people. Ironically this bonding is also one of the main reasons that keep people in companies like this, as
they “enjoy” their team and think it is the “best team ever”.

Don’t fall into this trap. Creating bonds out of long hours
is a problem and you should not let your “good team” blind
you.

### Red flag 6: Being given tasks by many managers

Task management is one of the most basic problems a company must solve. There are many software suites for this issue,
so it should be easy to understand how tasks are created, who
assigns them, and who owns them. One of the classic questions that you should ask in the interview is who assigns tasks
to your team.

In a well-organized company you get tasks from a single
person – your manager. Each task has also an expected time
frame, importance, and difficulty. It is okay if another task
needs priority before the one you are currently assigned to.
You should suspend it and resume working on it later.

A big problem is the unclear ownership of tasks. A typical
bad day looks something like this:

 1. In the morning, you get a task from your manager and
start working on it.
 1. At noon, another team is having issues with a deadline.
Another manager asks for your help. You switch tasks.
 1. Something breaks in production and a third manager asks
you to fix the issue right away. You switch tasks.

Then, the next day, the first two managers are sad to realize that
you didn’t work on what they thought you should work on.

Problems like this are a big red flag for the organization
of the company. It is okay if the tasks you work on come
from multiple people, but they should also be aware of one
another. Ideally, only a single person should be your manager. Having multiple managers passing you tasks shows that
the company treats software developers as factory workers
who can quickly move from one machine to another just by
shouting over.

### Red flag 7: Being asked all the time about your current task

Going back to the subject of task management, I already
mentioned that there are a lot of software suites designed
exclusively for this reason. Any internal or external project
stakeholder should be able to get at a glance the current status of a project. The task/issue system should be the single
source of truth for the status of the project. Reports and status updates should be easily exportable from the system itself
without the need for manual intervention.

Of course, this assumes that the company has a good issue
system in place and people know how to use it. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. A very common problem for
developers is getting continuous interruptions in regards to
what they are working now and what they are going to work
on next. This is a red flag for several reasons.

Getting interruptions all the time is a bad way to work as
a developer. Getting into the zone requires uninterrupted periods of time that allow you to think and write code. It is
very difficult to get work done if most of your day is spent on
micromanagement discussions.

The more important problem is that this micromanagement
shows an unorganized company. Either the task management
system is ineffective or the company does not know how to
use it. Lack of knowledge on task management almost always
maps to lack of project management in general. Missed deadlines, wrong estimates and unrealistic expectations go hand-in-hand with micromanagement.

An even bigger red flag is being required to attend special
meetings that were created specifically for “getting a status”
update on the project. Wasting people’s time with something
that is already offered by the system shows a company that
doesn’t understand how software gets developed.

### Red flag 8: Not getting access to production environments or new tools

A professional in a field is somebody who has access to the
best tools of the trade and also knows how to use them. The
same is true for developers. New tools and technologies come
out all the time. In most cases, they solve problems that needed manual work before their appearance.

Your company should have an official process for getting
access to new tools, updating existing tools, and generally
keeping up with the developments in the specific business
area. Developers should have the freedom to evaluate new
technologies and create prototypes for interesting tools.

Unfortunately, a lot of companies still think with the "if it
works, don’t fix it" mentality. Legacy projects are announced
as frozen and tool upgrading becomes a lengthy process with
various layers of manual approvals. If you realize that you
spend more time every day battling with the company process
than actually getting work done, the battle is already lost.

In a similar topic, developers should also get access to production systems and all the systems they need access to. It is
okay to have extra security checks and failsafe facilities in
place, but the company should trust its developers that they
can get the job done without having to jump through extra
hoops.

### Red flag 9: Limited Internet access and no admin account on workstation

Another way companies do not trust developers is when they
limit Internet access and workstation privileges. Working with the best tools possible is a prerequisite for any developer. Any developer should be able to choose their favorite
terminals, editors, IDEs and so on. A company that locks
down workstations essentially does not trust their developers
to have the knowledge they are supposed to have.

Another red flag is limited Internet access. Disabling all
sites for social media might seem like a good idea initially,
but it also cuts developers from learning about new tools and
technologies. Content filtering solutions are never perfect
and they can often be problematic in what content they allow through. Treating developers with mistrust and assuming
that they will want to slack off all day is a red flag as it shows
how a company treats people in general and not just in their
browsing habits.

Fun fact: There are several companies that instead of cutting access to specific sites do the exact opposite. All sites are
banned by default and you need to request access for a specific site that you need. Sad, but true.

### Red flag 10: Getting a counter-offer when you say you are leaving

Maybe you learned everything you could learn. Maybe you
got bored. Maybe you had long hours. Maybe you found several of the other red flags mentioned here to be true. At some
point, it is perfectly normal to leave your current company.

In some cases, you might get a counter-offer. Your company is giving you a raise to stay. There are many articles
online that try to propose a solution and whether you should
accept the counter-offer or not. I am actually amazed at why
this topic is so controversial. The answer is very simple. You
should reject the counter-offer and move on. Getting a counter offer is a huge red flag in the first place.

First of all, it means that the company knows it is underpaying you. If they are ready to offer you a raise for the same
role, why didn’t they do it earlier?

Secondly, it doesn’t solve the problem of your original decision to leave. The reasons that forced you to leave will still
be there if you accept the counter-offer. If the original reason
was about money, then trying to get a raise by trying to leave
is the worst way possible to achieve it.

Getting a counter-offer shows that the company does not
pay attention to its most important capital, its people. This is
also true if you learn that one of your colleagues was presented with a counter-offer, it doesn’t have to be you to understand the mentality of the company.

### In conclusion

There you have it! I hope that this article gave you some
ideas on what to ask in your next interview, how to understand if your company values you, and how to talk to friends
that are trapped in horrible companies because of "the good
team".
